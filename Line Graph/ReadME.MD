## Features

- Visualize global development data for different world regions.
- Interact with the line charts to explore data over time.
- Filter the data based on years, world regions, and opacity.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/d3-data-visualization.git


### Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the visualization.
Usage
### The JavaScript code in the provided file (main.js) is used to create interactive line charts. The code handles filtering data based on selected world regions, years, and opacity, and it updates the visualization accordingly.

## The code uses D3.js to perform the following tasks:

- Data loading and processing
- Creating and updating line charts
- Handling user interactions and events

### You can customize the global development data to be visualized and adjust various parameters such as opacity, start year, and end year according to your requirements.

## Data Sources
This project uses two data sources: countries_regions.csv and global_development.csv. Make sure to have these data files available in the data directory for the visualization to work.

## Additional Information
You can further enhance and modify the code to suit your specific data visualization needs. Feel free to explore and extend the project for your data visualization projects.

## Happy data visualizing!
