- Explore the dataset to draw insights into the impact of education on economic growth.


### Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the visualization.

### Usage

### The D3.js code in the JavaScript file (main.js) creates two interactive bar charts:

## Chart One: States with High Growth Rate

- This chart displays states with a growth rate greater than 20% and a literacy rate less than or equal to 80%.
Hover over bars to view state-specific information.
Chart Two: States with Low Growth Rate

- This chart displays states with a growth rate less than or equal to 20% and a literacy rate less than or equal to 80%.
Hover over bars to view state-specific information.
